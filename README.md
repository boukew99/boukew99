# Hoi World
My projects have a preference for UI & accessibiliy. The code is typically functional and concise.

## Web and Linux
- [Chitch Backend](https://github.com/boukew99/chitch), modular and functional web backend, build for sustainability.
- [Modern Bano](https://github.com/boukew99/modern-nano), terminal editor config.
- [Debian meta package](https://github.com/boukew99/debian-meta-package), small utility to make debian dependencies more declarative, like Nix is.

## Godot Engine Demos and Addons
I used to be active in the Godot Engine Community and published severeal games on itch.io.

On Github I host educational projects on using Godot's UI nodes for creative applications.
